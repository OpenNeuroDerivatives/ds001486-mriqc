    "TaskDescription": "Subjects were presented with a single digit subtraction problem (prime) followed by an answer (target). 24 number pairs were used. These number pairs were broken down into 12 ‘easy’ and 12 ‘hard’ problems. Easy problems were characterized by a small difference in the first and second operand (i.e. 1, 2 or 3). Harder problems were characterized by a larger difference between the first and second operand (i.e. 4, 5 or 6), and a large first operand (i.e. 6, 7, 8 or 9). Tie problems (e.g. 5-5) and problems involving 0 or 1 as second operand were not included. Each problem was repeated twice with a true answer, and once with a false answer provided as the target. False answers were generated by adding 1 or 2 to the correct answer (e.g. 8 – 2 = 7), or by subtracting 1 from the correct answer (e.g., 8 – 2 = 5). Each stimulus was presented for 800 ms on a white background separated by a 200 ms interstimulus interval. The target stimulus was followed by a red fixation square lasting 2200-3000 ms. Participants could respond as soon as the target was presented until the beginning of the next trial unless otherwise noted in README file. Twenty-four control trials were included to take motor responses into account. In these trials a blue square was presented for 800 ms followed by a red fixation square lasting 2200-3000 ms. This yielded 96 trials. Trials were divided into two separate 48 trial runs titled task-Sub_run-01 and task-Sub_run-02. Each run ended with the presentation of a red square for 22000 ms.",
