    "TaskDescription": "Subjects were presented with two monosyllabic English words and asked to make a rhyming judgement. Word pairs were categorized into four conditions: 12 pairs were orthographically similar and phonologically similar (O+P+), 10 pairs were orthographically similar and phonologically different (O+P-), 10 pairs were orthographically different and phonologically similar (O-P+), and 14 pairs were orthographically different and phonologically different (O-P-). Thirteen perceptual trials were included involving matching judgements of non-alphabetic characters. The characters were presented as increasing, decreasing, or steady in height. Subjects were asked to report whether the two presented stimuli matched or did not. Each word or string of characters was presented for 800 ms separated by a 200 ms interstimulus interval. The second stimulus was followed by a red fixation square lasting 2200-3000 ms. Participants could respond as soon as the second word was presented until the beginning of the next trial. Twenty-five control trials were included to take motor responses into account. In these trials a blue square was presented for 800 ms followed by a red fixation square lasting 2200-3000 ms. This yielded 84 trials. Task ended with the presentation of a red square for 22000 ms.",
